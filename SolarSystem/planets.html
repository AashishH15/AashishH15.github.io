            <h2>Mercury</h2>
            <p>Mercury is the smallest and fastest planet in our solar system. It has a diameter of 4,879 km, which is only slightly larger than Earth’s moon. It orbits the Sun at a speed of 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second.</p>
            <p>Mercury has a very long day and a very short year. A day on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days, while a year on Mercury takes only 88 Earth days. This means that one day on Mercury is longer than two years on Mercury!</p>
            <p>Mercury has a very eccentric orbit, meaning that it is not a perfect circle but more of an oval shape. This causes its distance from the Sun to vary from 46 million km to 70 million km. This also causes its temperature to range from -173°C to 427°C [-279°F to 801°F].</p>
            <p>Mercury has no moons or rings, and almost no atmosphere. This makes it vulnerable to impacts from asteroids and comets, which have created many craters on its surface. Some of these craters contain water ice, which can survive in the dark and cold regions near Mercury’s poles.</p>
            <p>The existence of water ice on Mercury was first suggested by radar observations from Earth in 1991. It was later confirmed by NASA’s MESSENGER probe, which orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015. MESSENGER also collected data on Mercury’s surface, atmosphere, magnetosphere and geology.
                MESSENGER was the second mission to explore Mercury, after Mariner 10, which flew by the planet three times in 1974 and 1975. Mariner 10 was the first to image Mercury’s surface and measure its magnetic field.
                The current mission to Mercury is BepiColombo, a joint project of ESA and JAXA. It launched in 2018 and will arrive at Mercury in 2025. It consists of two orbiters: one to study Mercury’s surface and exosphere (MPO), and one to study its magnetosphere (MMO)</p>
            <p>Mercury is named after the Roman messenger god, who was known for his speed and agility. He wore winged sandals and a winged hat, and carried a staff called a caduceus.</p>

            <h2>Venus</h2>
            <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and it is the second brightest object in the night sky after the Moon. It is often referred to as the Earth's sister planet due to their similar size and mass.</p>
